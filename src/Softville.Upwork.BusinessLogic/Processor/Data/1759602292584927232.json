    "description": "This project involves development of a WPF-based .NET Windows application that will display web page(s) using Microsoft\u0027s WebView2 control. The application to be developed will essentially be a simple web browser that uses javascript injection and APIs to supervise the health of the displayed web pages as well as provide functions to the web pages that would not normally be available in the javascript sandbox.\n\nOther features included in this project:\n- REST APIs to monitor the status of our connected servers \n- WPF UI to display the status of the connected servers\n- A basic IIS test platform to simulate the different failure states\n- A TOML configuration system for various settings\n- An installer to load the software onto a Windows PC\n\nNote that the contents of the displayed HTML pages are outside the scope of this project. All this application needs to do is display the pages per the configuration file and interact with them as defined in the full specification document. However, some knowledge of IIS/ASP.net will be needed in order to build up the required integration tests.\n\nThe full project specification document is attached. We ask that you be able to immediately start work on this project, since there are other concurrent projects that will interface with the software you generate. Since we are planning on running this as an hourly project, please provide an estimate for how long you believe this will take. Finally, we will require check-ins to our Github repository at least weekly so that we can supervise the project and make sure we\u0027re on the same page.\n\nThank you for your interest, and please let us know if you have any questions.",
