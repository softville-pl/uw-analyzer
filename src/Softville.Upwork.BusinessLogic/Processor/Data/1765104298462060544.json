    "description": "Job Post\n\nWe\u2019re looking for a highly competent senior WPF/C#/.NET developer to work with my company on a full time basis as we prepare a newly acquired trading platform for its retail market focused relaunch later this year. The first month or more of this job is going to be dedicated entirely to improving the platform\u0027s stability and usability, bug ticket by bug ticket. Later as you gain familiarity, it\u2019s going to be implementing features. \n\nWe\u2019re hiring for this role in the hopes that whomever we hire can become more of a lead developer \u0026 core part of the team in terms of programming and leadership. Here\u2019s a list of the things we\u2019d like candidates to have:\n\n- WPF experience. We\u2019re not using MVVM, nor complex data binding, or highly specific SDKs. General WPF experience is enough.\n\n- Communication skills. We\u2019re a small team, bring up issues you see, reach out to people as needed, communicate your schedule before people need to know, etc.   Must be able to speak and understand fluent English.  Must be able to accommodate a USA/CAD time zone overlap.\n\n- Trading experience (optional but a big plus). Doesn\u2019t need to be development experience specifically, but familiarity with trading will help you understand the product quickly. Be sure to mention it in your application if you have any experience.\n\n- Agile experience (optional). Eventually we\u2019re hoping the right candidate can lead our scrum meetings, help plan sprints etc.\n\n- Internal COMM\u0027s:  We use Google, Slack, Jira , Sentry and other basic tech stacks that are standard for such role.  Basic or avid experience of them is expected.\n\n- Official Job Post Link Here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/11b62bcb-7z1m-TBREB4l5CEs3x_yKDIdbmRXYh0Plck/edit\n\n",
