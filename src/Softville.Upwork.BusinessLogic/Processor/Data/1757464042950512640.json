    "description": "Job Task Description:\n\nWe are seeking an experienced C# .Net Core developer to assist us with server-to-server Android in-app purchase verification. Our team has successfully implemented a server-to-server receipt verification mechanism for Apple and now aims to extend these capabilities to include Google Play Store purchases.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n- Implement server-to-server verification for Android in-app purchases made through Google Play Store.\n- Work closely with our development team to integrate this new verification mechanism into our existing bespoke server, which hosts several services.\n- Ensure that the process seamlessly authenticates Google Play Store receipts, enabling us to process orders on our bespoke server accurately.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- Proficiency in C# and .Net Core development.\n- Experience with server-to-server communication and API integrations.\n- Familiarity with Android in-app purchase workflows and Google Play Developer API.\n- Ability to extend existing codebases with new functionality while maintaining system integrity.\n- Previous experience with in-app purchase verification (especially with Google Play Store) is highly desirable.\n\nProject Context:\n\nOur bespoke server runs multiple services, and we have a separate client-facing application software through which customers can make in-app purchases on the Android platform. The successful candidate will ensure that once a purchase is made, the Google receipt returned from the Play Store is authenticated against Google\u0027s servers. This authentication is crucial for us to successfully process the order on our server.\n\nWe are looking for a developer who can tackle this challenge efficiently and contribute to our ongoing efforts to provide a seamless in-app purchase experience for our customers. If you have the skills and experience we\u0027re looking for, we\u0027d love to hear from you.",
