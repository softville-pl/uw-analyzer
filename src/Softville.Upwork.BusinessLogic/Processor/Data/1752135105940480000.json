Are there ramifications to our SharePoint site (licensing, costs) if this happens for thousands of documents?\n\n2.\tSecurity: in SharePoint, can you create a one-time use link for the document?  This would simplify our concerns for security.  If that\u0027s not possible, do you have any suggestions that would help?  We are worried that a link could be shared, guessed, etc. and we need to ensure the data is secure.\n\n3.\tSyncing the changes: when the document edits are completed, how will our system be triggered to copy the updated file from SharePoint?  We\u0027d like to have a notification through the Graph API that the session has ended but haven\u0027t identified the API yet.
