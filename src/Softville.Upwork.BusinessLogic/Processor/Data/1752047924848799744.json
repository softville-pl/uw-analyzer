Code Minimization:\n- Consolidate the existing .cs files into fewer files to minimize the overall number of files and\ndirectories.\n- Aim for a structure that contains key files, such as:\n- A single file for all instructions (instead of a directory full of files for each instruction).\n- A Compiler.cs file.\n- A \u0027helpers.cs\u0027 file\n- A main.cs file that instantiates the Compiler object, compiles hardcoded WASM bytecode,\nand then writes the output to the console, similarly to dotnet-webassembly\/Examples\/RunExisting\/Program.cs\n- ...etc (see requirement 4 below)\n\n2. Maintain Functionality:\n- Ensure that all existing unit tests pass after refactoring.\n- Maintain the full functionality of the project as it is in the current state.\n\n3. .NET 6.0 Compatibility:\n- Update the project to target the .NET 6.0 framework instead of the current netstandard2.0.\n\n4. Acceptable Increase in File Count:\n- While minimizing the number of files is a priority, an increase in the total count is acceptable if it contributes to a more streamlined and minimalistic codebase.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n1. A refactored version of the dotnet-webassembly project meeting the above requirements.\n\n2. Documentation outlining the changes made, including any new file structures or major code\nreorganizations.\n\n3. Proof that all unit tests pass in the refactored version.\n\n4. Confirmation of successful build and operation under .NET 6.0.\n\n5. A Dockerfile (and any needed bash script) to build the image, build the project and run all the\nunit tests (This can substitute deliverables 3 and 4)\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- While the focus is on minimalism, readability and maintainability of the code should not be compromised.\n- The refactoring should be done in a way that aligns with best practices for .NET development.","attachments":[{"fileName":"Refactoring_task.pdf","length":68068,"uri":"\/att\/download\/openings\/1752047924848799744\/attachments\/ffd32703-8bed-4714-a189-03791a085586\/download"}],"questions":[{"position":0,"question":"Describe your recent experience with similar projects"},{"position":1,"question":"Include a link to your GitHub profile and\/or website"}],"qualifications":{"type":0,"location":null,"minOdeskHours":0,"groupRecno":null,"shouldHavePortfolio":false,"tests":null,"minHoursWeek":0,"group":null,"prefEnglishSkill":3,"minJobSuccessScore":0,"risingTalent":false,"locationCheckRequired":false,"countries":null,"regions":null,"states":null,"timezones":null,"localMarket":false,"onSiteType":null,"locations":null,"localDescription":null,"localFlexibilityDescription":null,"earnings":null,"languages":null},"isPremium":false,"segmentationData":[{"name":"Employment","value":"EMPLOYMENT_PROJECT","label":"One-time project","type":"EMPLOYMENT","sortOrder":0,"typeUid":"535792587707281410","customValue":null,"skill":null}],"clientActivity":{"lastBuyerActivity":"2024-02-01T16:07:04.566Z","totalApplicants":18,"totalHired":0,"totalInvitedToInterview":4,"unansweredInvites":0,"invitationsSent":0},"weeklyRetainerBudget":null,"annotations":{"tags":["contractToHireSet","searchable"],"customFields":{"siteSource":"desktop_rjp","publishTime":"2024-01-29T22:15:54.208Z","reuse":"1749764460057882624","totalTimeJobPostFlowAIv2":"0","sourcingUpdateCount":"0","sourcingUpdateForbidden":"false","totalTimeSpentOnReviewPageAIv2":"58","type":"FJP","browser":"Firefox","device":"Linux"}},"isContractToHire":false,"recruitingServices":null},"buyer":{"isPaymentMethodVerified":true,"location":{"offsetFromUtcMillis":-10800000,"countryTimezone":"Singapore (America\/B)","city":null,"country":"Singapore"},"stats":{"totalAssignments":0,"activeAssignmentsCount":0,"feedbackCount":0,"score":0,"totalJobsWithHires":0,"hoursCount":0,"totalCharges":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":0}},"isEnterprise":false,"company":{"isEDCReplicated":false,"contractDate":"2024-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","profile":{"size":"2","industry":"Tech \u0026 IT","visible":true,"l3Occupations":[]}},"jobs":{"postedCount":7,"openCount":0},"avgHourlyJobsRate":null},"currentUserInfo":{"owner":false,"freelancerInfo":{"qualificationsMatches":{"totalQualifications":3,"totalMatches":3,"matches":[{"qualification":0,"qualified":true,"clientPreferred":"all","freelancerValue":"IC","freelancerValueLabel":"Not Specified","clientPreferredLabel":"Any"},{"qualification":4,"qualified":true,"clientPreferred":"3","freelancerValue":"3","freelancerValueLabel":"Fluent","clientPreferredLabel":"Fluent"},{"qualification":10,"qualified":true,"clientPreferred":"Any","freelancerValue":"en","freelancerValueLabel":"English","clientPreferredLabel":null}]},"applied":null,"hired":null,"contract":null,"profileState":10,"hourlyRate":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":56},"devProfileCiphertext":"~01256f0be21d7e2c1e","application":null,"pendingInvite":null}},"paths":{"js":"\/nx\/jobs\/search"},"ff":{"isRemoveClientTotalSpentCap":true,"isJobDetailsQuickJobPost":true,"CFE6770ImprovedQualificationsSection":true,"jdShowInvitesCount":true,"enforceMinimumRateInProfile":true,"TSV1877IDVatSubmitProposal":true,"AG2156TeamsAddRoleFlow":true,"CLOB6375ExpandedCompanyProfile":true},"qt":[],"experiments":{"idvOnSubmitProposals":{"soft":false,"hard":false,"idv_required":false,"idv_complete":false}},"isVisitor":false}
